# A Similar Google Image Search Application

### API USED

In this Project, I have used Unsplash API which returna bunch of pictures based upon the search term.

## WorkFlow

I have divided the projects in two parts -

(i) I have fetched the images using axios and lined them up in square Tile structure (that is pictures are lined up in accordance to their size below one another)

(ii) Secondly, I tried to arrange them as google dows in a compact Tile manner such that different sizes images are put aside one another automatically
